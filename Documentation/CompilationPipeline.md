To demonstrate the Skynoble compiler and its pipeline from AST (Hexadecimal) to x64 Assembly and then to Executable Binary, I will lay out a conceptual approach and the corresponding code. This explanation focuses on how Skynoble's code would work in its pipeline steps.

### Skynoble Compiler Pipeline Overview

1. **Skynoble Source Code (Input)**
   - The user writes Skynoble code in the language's syntax.
   
2. **Step 1: Convert Skynoble to Hexadecimal IR (Intermediate Representation)**
   - The Skynoble code is translated into Hexadecimal IR, which is a low-level representation that can be directly mapped to x64 Assembly.

3. **Step 2: Convert Hexadecimal IR to x64 Assembly**
   - The Hexadecimal IR is then converted into equivalent x64 Assembly.

4. **Step 3: Assemble x64 Assembly to Executable Binary**
   - The x64 Assembly code is assembled into a raw binary using a tool like NASM or GCC.

### 1. Skynoble Source Code

Example code written in Skynoble:

```skynoble
let x = 5;           # Immutable
let y = 10 @mut(true);  # Mutable

func add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b;
}

if (x == 5) {
    x = 20;
} else {
    x = 30;
}

while (x < 10) {
    x += 1;
}
```

### 2. Conversion to Hexadecimal IR (AST)

For the code above, we translate it to Hexadecimal IR. Here’s what that could look like:

#### Variable Declaration

```skynoble
let x = 5;
```

Hexadecimal IR:

```hex
B8 05 00 00 00     # MOV EAX, 5
A3 00 10 60 00     # MOV [0x601000], EAX (store in memory)
```

#### If-Else Statement

```skynoble
if (x == 5) {
    x = 20;
} else {
    x = 30;
}
```

Hexadecimal IR:

```hex
A1 00 10 60 00     # MOV EAX, [0x601000] (load x)
83 F8 05           # CMP EAX, 5
75 06              # JNE ELSE_BRANCH
B8 14 00 00 00     # MOV EAX, 20
EB 04              # JMP END_IF
ELSE_BRANCH:
B8 1E 00 00 00     # MOV EAX, 30
END_IF:
A3 00 10 60 00     # MOV [0x601000], EAX (store x)
```

#### Loop (While Loop)

```skynoble
while (x < 10) {
    x += 1;
}
```

Hexadecimal IR:

```hex
LOOP_START:
A1 00 10 60 00     # MOV EAX, [0x601000] (load x)
83 F8 0A           # CMP EAX, 10
7D 06              # JGE END_LOOP
83 C0 01           # ADD EAX, 1
A3 00 10 60 00     # MOV [0x601000], EAX (store x)
EB F3              # JMP LOOP_START
END_LOOP:
```

### 3. Conversion from Hexadecimal IR to x64 Assembly

Now, let’s convert the Hexadecimal IR into x64 Assembly code.

#### x64 Assembly Equivalent for the Above Code

```assembly
section .data
    x dd 5          ; x initialized to 5

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, [x]    ; Load x into EAX register
    cmp eax, 5      ; Compare EAX with 5
    jne else_branch ; If not equal, jump to else_branch
    mov eax, 20     ; Set EAX to 20
    jmp end_if      ; Jump to end_if

else_branch:
    mov eax, 30     ; Set EAX to 30

end_if:
    mov [x], eax    ; Store value of EAX back to x

    ; Now, the while loop starts
LOOP_START:
    mov eax, [x]    ; Load x into EAX
    cmp eax, 10     ; Compare EAX with 10
    jge end_loop    ; If greater than or equal, exit loop
    add eax, 1      ; Increment EAX (x += 1)
    mov [x], eax    ; Store updated x value
    jmp LOOP_START  ; Repeat the loop

end_loop:
    mov eax, 60     ; Exit system call number
    xor edi, edi    ; Status code 0
    syscall         ; Call the system
```

### 4. Assembly to Executable Binary

#### Step 1: Windows Compilation using MSVC + NASM

First, save the assembly code to `skynoble.asm`.

Then assemble it using NASM:

```bash
nasm -f win64 -o skynoble.obj skynoble.asm
```

Now link the object file with MSVC to generate the executable:

```bash
link /subsystem:console skynoble.obj kernel32.lib msvcrt.lib /out:skynoble.exe
```

#### Step 2: Linux Compilation using GCC + NASM

For Linux, use the following steps:

Assemble the code:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 -o skynoble.o skynoble.asm
```

Then link it with GCC:

```bash
gcc -o skynoble skynoble.o
```

### Final Result

Once the compilation is complete, you'll have an executable binary (`skynoble.exe` on Windows or `skynoble.out` on Linux) that will run the Skynoble program with native machine speed.

### Skynoble Compiler Features

- **Hexadecimal IR**: Skynoble uses a custom intermediate representation in hexadecimal that is directly mapped to machine code instructions for efficient compilation.
- **Self-Healing Code**: Skynoble has built-in support for detecting faults in code and automatically repairing them during runtime, ensuring system stability.
- **Real-Time Optimization**: The language has features that enable real-time performance monitoring and optimization based on system metrics.
